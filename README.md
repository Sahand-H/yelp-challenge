## Setup

Ensure that Python 3.6 is installed somewhere that `pipenv` can find it.
One way to do this is using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).

Opening a Jupyter notebook:

```sh
pipenv install
pipenv shell
jupyter notebook
```


## Running

```sh
pipenv install
pipenv run python clustering/preprocess.py
```
